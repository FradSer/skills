# Stop hook — enforce the review-pr closeout: the merge decision must be
# resolved before the turn ends.
#
# Background: the review-pr skill runs on prompt alone, so the Phase 5 merge ask
# ("ask the user whether to merge before any closeout ceremony") can be skipped
# by a hallucinated or premature stop. The skill arms a state file
# (.git/review-pr-closeout.json) the moment Phase 4's stop conditions hold and
# clears it once the user's merge choice is in (or the --auto-merge closeout ran
# or aborted). While the file exists, this hook blocks one turn-end per user
# turn with a message naming the PR and the missing step — the ask cannot
# silently vanish, and it does not loop: after the single block the turn ends.
#
# Guard rails (this hook fires on EVERY turn end — Stop has no matcher):
#   - Fails open: no jq, no git repo, no state file, or a subagent stop
#     (agent_id present in the input — a subagent cannot ask the user) all pass.
#   - Fires at most once per user turn: stop_hook_active is true when the turn
#     is already continuing from a stop-hook block — pass through so the turn
#     can end. The single block injects the reminder once; resolving the closeout
#     (the merge ask or clear-closeout) is what removes the state file.
#   - Blocks via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (exit 0 + JSON): the
#     message is fed back to the model as "Stop hook feedback" and the turn
#     continues — same loop protections as a decision:block, without the
#     hook-error label.
#
# Input (stdin JSON): Stop common fields + stop_hook_active,
#   last_assistant_message, background_tasks, session_crons.
