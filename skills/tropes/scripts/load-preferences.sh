# load-preferences.sh — merge four-tier office.*.json preferences
#
# Reads up to four preference files, deep-merges them in precedence order, and
# prints the merged JSON object to stdout.
#
# Precedence (highest to lowest — .local overrides shared, project overrides global):
#   1. ./.agents/office.local.json        (project, personal/gitignored)
#   2. ./.agents/office.json              (project, shared/committed)
#   3. ~/.agents/office.local.json        (global, personal)
#   4. ~/.agents/office.json              (global, shared)
#
# Merge semantics (applied low->high, each layer overlays the prior):
#   object x object -> recursive deep merge
#   array   x array -> concatenate + dedupe (plain strings by identity;
#                       objects in .pattern_caps deduped by .id keeping higher layer;
#                       objects in .dead_metaphors.entries deduped by .word keeping higher layer)
#   scalar  x scalar -> higher layer wins when non-null
#   null in higher layer -> keep lower layer value (inherit)
#
# Output: single merged JSON object on stdout. On any error (missing jq,
# missing/invalid files), fails open to '{}' so the tropes skill still runs
# with default rules.
#
# Env overrides (for testing), each may be set to a path or empty:
#   OFFICE_PROJECT_LOCAL   default ./.agents/office.local.json
#   OFFICE_PROJECT_SHARED  default ./.agents/office.json
#   OFFICE_GLOBAL_LOCAL    default ~/.agents/office.local.json
#   OFFICE_GLOBAL_SHARED   default ~/.agents/office.json

# Deep merge program. `merge(a;b)` recursively combines two values:
# - both objects: merge key-by-key (b's null keeps a's value)
# - both arrays: concatenate then dedup via `dedup`
# - otherwise: b wins (unless b is null, then a wins)
#
# `dedup` handles three array shapes:
# - objects with .id (pattern_caps): group by .id, keep last (higher layer wins)
# - objects with .word (dead_metaphors.entries): group by .word, keep last
# - anything else (strings): unique
